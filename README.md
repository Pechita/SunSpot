# SunSpot
This project aims to facilitate and reduce the cost of solar panel assessment. It will use UV sensors to track the sun and change the panels angle to the optimal one at that time. A user-friendly application will come along with this device to familiarize the users with their panels as well as help them chose the best configurations.
